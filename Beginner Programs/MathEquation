#Desc: program will solve the linear equation y = mx + b. Create variables of type float for y, m, and b and solve for x. 

# user input
y = int(input("Y-Value: "))      #y
m = float(input("Slope: "))      #slope
b = int(input("Y-Intercept: "))  #y-intercept

# solve for x
x = (int(y) - (int(b))/m)  #typecast y and b to an int first

# output answer
print ("X-Value: " + str(x))
