#Desc: Program takes the users inputs for length and width. Using the input, the program creates a rectangle and tells the user the perimeter and area of that rectangle

#INPUT: Ask user for length and with of the triangle, while also using float to allow decimal input
rect_length = float((input)("Input the length of your rectangle:"))
rect_width = float((input)("Input the width of your rectangle:"))

#PROCESSING: calculating the area of the rectangle with the users input
area_rectangle_created = (rect_length*rect_width)

#OUTPUT: telling the user the area of the shape in meters squared
print(area_rectangle_created, "m2 is the area")

#PROCESSING: calculating the perimeter of the rectangle using the users input
perimeter_rectangle_created = ((rect_length*2)+(rect_width*2))

#OUTPUT: telling the user the perimeter of the rectangle
print(perimeter_rectangle_created, "m is the perimeter")
