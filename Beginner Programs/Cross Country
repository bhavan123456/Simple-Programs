#Desc: Program calculates how long it takes Bhavan to run 5 mile laps with 3 fast pased laps and 2 easy pased laps in minutes and seconds

#PROCESSING: Initializing the constants that are Bhavan's running times
easy_pase = ((4 * 60)+15)
fast_pase = ((3 * 60)+12)

#OUTPUT: these upcoming lines will output how much time it takes in seconds on each lap for Bhavan to run
print("Lap 1 =", easy_pase, "seconds") #Lap 1
print("Lap 2 =", fast_pase, "seconds") #Lap 2
print("Lap 3 =", fast_pase, "seconds") #Lap 3
print("Lap 4 =", fast_pase, "seconds") #Lap 4
print("Lap 5 =", easy_pase, "seconds") #Lap 5

#PROCESSING: combining all the time for each lap toghether to declare the total time
total_time = (((easy_pase * 2) + (fast_pase * 3)))

#PROCESSING: calcullating the minutes and seconds of the total time
minutes = total_time // 60
seconds = total_time % 60

#OUTPUT: outputting how long it took Bhavan to run 5 mile laps in minutes and seconds
print("Bhavan will take", minutes, "minutes and", seconds, "seconds to run 5 mile laps!")
