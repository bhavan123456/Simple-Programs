#Desc: program will prompt the user for two numbers and prompt the user for one of five mathematical operations to perform

#INPUT&PROCESSING: Prompt the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

#INPUT&PROCESSING: Prompt the user for a mathematical operation
operation = input("Enter the operation to perform (1: add, 2: subtract, 3: multiply, 4: divide, 5: exponentiation): ")

#PROCESSING: Perform the selected operation
if operation == "1":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "2":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "3":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "4":
    result = num1 / num2
elif operation == "5":
    result = num1 ** num2
else:
    print("Invalid option")
    exit()

#OUTPUT: Print the result
print("Result: ", result)
