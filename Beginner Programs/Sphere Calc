#Desc: Program uses the sphere calculation to calculate the volume of a sphere with the radius of 5

#PROCESSING: we need to import math to perform certain concepts that aren't functions in python
import math

#PROCESSING: creating the variable for radius. Since we are given 5, the radius will be 5
radius = 5
volume = (4/3)*math.pi*(radius ** 3) #PROCESSING: calculating the volume of the sphere using the calculation
print(volume) #OUTPUT: Prints the volume
