#Desc: for loop to prompt for and input 10 floats

# Initialize variables
total = 0
largest = float("-inf")

# Prompt for and input 10 floats
for i in range(10):
    number = float(input(f"Enter float number {i+1}: "))
    total += number

    if number > largest:
        largest = number

# Calculate the average
average = total / 10

# Output the average and the largest number
print(f"Average: {average}")
print(f"Largest number: {largest}")
