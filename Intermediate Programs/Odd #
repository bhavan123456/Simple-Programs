# Iterate over the range from 1 to end_value (inclusive)
for number in range(1, end_value + 1):
    # Check if the number is odd
    if number % 2 != 0:
        # Print the odd number
        print(number)
        # Add the odd number to the sum
        sum_of_numbers += number

# Print the total sum
print("The total sum is:", sum_of_numbers)
