#Desc: same as Odd.py, but with even numbers

#INPUT&PROCESSING: Take user input for the end value
end_value = int(input("Enter the end value: "))

# Initialize the sum variable
sum_of_numbers = 0

# Iterate over the range from 1 to end_value
for number in range(2, end_value + 1):
    # Check if the number is odd
    if number % 2 != 1:
        # Print the odd number
        print(number)
        # Add the odd number to the sum
        sum_of_numbers += number

# Print the total sum
print("The total sum is:", sum_of_numbers)
